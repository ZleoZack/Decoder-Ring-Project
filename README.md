# Decoder-Ring-Project

Here we were faced with NOSY NEIGHBORS and couldn't say anything with out them running and telling the Cookie Monster MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET COOKIES!
We have in that case implemented three very beautiful Encoding/Decoding softwares created using JavaScript.
The functionality of these softwares is to take in a coded or decoded message, as well as which Alphabet key we would like to use and shift the coded sequence by creating our very own ALGORITHYMS! It was very exciting utilizing these new implementations, and assigning keys to different values. As well as using IF/ELSE statements to handle Edge cases.

Future plans for this are to implement REACT and Route things with different components to grow the application and implement it for secret note passing back and forth between highschool sweethearts all over the US!
